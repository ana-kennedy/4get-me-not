  - A LONG TIME AGO...
  - OVER A HUNDRED YEARS NOW.
  - I CAME HERE FROM A FAR AWAY PLACE...
  - THE SAME PLACE AS BIRDIE.
  - I WAS THE GOLF PRINCESS OF THE UNIVERSE.
  - MY FAVORITE PLACE TO COME WAS HERE...
  - LIL TOWN.
  - THAT'S WHAT I CALL HOME, ANYWAY.
  - I CAME TO PLAY IN THE TOURNAMENT.
  - YOU KNOW, THE LIL TOWN ONE?
  - A GREAT EVIL CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS.
  - SHE APPEARED IN FRONT OF ME...
  - RIGHT AT THE END OF THE TOURNAMENT.
  - SHE PUT HER HAND OUT, DECEIVINGLY.
  - SHE SAID TO ME...
  - '"YOU HAVE BECOME A BRIDGE."'
  - I FELL ASLEEP.
  - SHE LOCKED ME IN HERE, THE NOME HOTEL.
  - THIS WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
  - HER NAME...
  - NATALYA.
