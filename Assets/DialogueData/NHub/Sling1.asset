  - HEY, WHAT'S UP?
  - THEY CALL ME SLING.
  - WELCOME TO OUR HOME, NOME.
  - YOU TALK TO THOSE PESKY GNOMES YET?
  - YEAH, THEY'RE A LITTLE OFF RIGHT?
  - I'M HERE FOR THE ANNUAL IDITAROD RACE.
  - YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN ME ON TV.
  - YOU HEAR ABOUT THE HOTEL?
  - WE'VE GOT THIS WEIRD LADY GNOME THERE.
  - SHE KINDA RUNS OUR CITIES INTERNAL POLITICS...
  - SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF US DOGS.
  - CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
  - WE HAVE A WORD FOR PEOPLE LIKE HER IN MY BREED.
  - ANYWAY, WELCOME TO NOME. ENJOY YOUR STAY.
