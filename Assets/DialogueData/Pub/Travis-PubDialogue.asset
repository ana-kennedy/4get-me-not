  - YOU MUST BE ANA.
  - CHER TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.
  - ...
  - YOU DON'T TALK MUCH, DO YOU?
  - THIS TOWN SURE IS STRANGE.
  - DO YOU BELIEVE IN ALIENS, ANA?
  - I SAW SOMETHING ON MY WAY IN I CAN'T EXPLAIN...
  - IT WAS A LIGHT, FLYING THROUGH THE AIR...
  - I FOLLOWED IT ON THE INTERSTATE... THEN...
  - IT JUST DISAPPEARED. INTO THE CAVE OUTSIDE TOWN.
  - I CAN TAKE YOU THERE, IF YOU LIKE.
  - IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, MEET ME AT THE DINER.
