    I CAN TELL YOU ARE CLOSE.

    THERE IS AN EVIL IN THIS
    BUILDING.

    SHE IS LOOKING FOR ME.

    I NEED YOU TO FIND ME.

    BEFORE
    SHE FINDS ME.

    THERE IS A PETAL IN THIS HOTEL.

    I NEED YOU TO FIND IT
    BEFORE SHE DOES.

    OR THIS WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.


    YOU HAVE BECOME
    A BRIDGE.


    ANASTASIA.'
